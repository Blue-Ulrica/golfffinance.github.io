Golff Farm is a financial experiment to generate initial governance tokens through liquidity mining and to attract a large number of users and funds to participate in the process. The liquidity mining to generate initial tokens is a fairer and more transparent way and helps Golff to acquire initial users quickly in a short period of time.Golff's liquidity mining will be divided into multiple phases to have a stronger sense of game experience and fun while mining for high returns, motivating users to participate more and more continuously. This is a simpler pledge mining business than Staking, with one click deposit and one click withdrawal, convenient and high yield.

## Golff Farm Advantages

- Multiple rounds of play iterations for more excitement and upgraded revenue Golff liquidity mining is divided into three rounds in the first phase. 6 pools in the first round have a competitive relationship with each other, the GXC pool, HT pool + the pool that ranks first in pledged market value in the first round, advances to King Pool and enjoys a 70% boost in incentives.

- Community-based governance, fair and equitable From the second round, community users can use their GOF to vote on the pools that can be mined for liquidity. From the third round onwards, new pools can be created by coin holders' votes. This not only puts the decision of how to produce GOF in the hands of the community, but also increases the intrinsic value and equity of GOF. Also this way can attract more communities of good coins to pay attention to GOF.
