# Community Governance

## Community Governance Proposal generation

**Purpose of this step:** Identify optimization points and problems of the Golff project, and find solutions to help the project grow better.

**How to achieve it:** During the process of community discussion and communication, community members discover the points that can be optimized in the Golff project and explore to find solutions to form a preliminary proposal. The proposal can be fully discussed in the community beforehand to facilitate the complete presentation of the proposal.

## Proposal Publicity and Optimization
**The purpose of this step:** The initial proposals are often inadequate, so during the public period, more people can participate in the discussion of the proposal to optimize its content.


**How to achieve:** After the community has fully discussed the proposal, the proposal can be publicized in the Golff Vote board for 48 hours. During the public period, community users can continue to leave comments and suggestions for optimization and reasonable discussion, and if there is no objection, they can vote for the proposal. If the proposal is flawed, the proposal sponsor can delete the original proposal and re-initiate the proposal for the corresponding publicity. The proposal will be approved only after 48 hours of publication and more than 10 people support the proposal. If a proposal is found to be politically sensitive or insulting during the posting period, Golff core developers have the right to stop posting the proposal on the Vote board.
 
## Proposal Referendum
**Purpose of this step:** The proposal will be voted on extensively in the community so that the final approved proposal represents the majority of GDAO-owning users.


**How this is accomplished:** Proposals that are approved will be publicly voted on in the Golff Vote board, where all GDAO-owning users can vote on the proposal.

**Proposal Passage Determination:** A proposal must pass the public vote if it meets the following conditions at the same time.
1. The proposal has undergone a 48-hour public process
2. Voting time is at least 24 hours
3. More than 4% of the total number of GDao currently in circulation have voted on the proposal
4. The ballot is approved

## Proposal Implementation and Monitoring
**The purpose of this step:** the proposals voted by the community need to be executed by the core team and the volunteer team, and be supervised by the community.

**How to achieve it:** The proposals voted by the community will be executed by the teams involved (development, strategy, product, community operation, content output) within 24 hours and the execution process will be synchronized through Golff's weekly project progress report.
