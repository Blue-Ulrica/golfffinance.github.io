## Revenue Distribution

The proceeds of various cryptocurrencies generated in the Heco Golff Vault pool are automatically put into the Vault pool, of which 91% of the proceeds are allocated to the fund contributors and the remaining 9% is used to repurchase GOF in the secondary market, of which 4% is for the community developer fund, 4% is destroyed, 1% is for the risk reserve, and the harvest contract call fees are borne by the developer fund. The risk reserve is used to cover losses incurred by Vault investors due to unforeseen risks. Secondary market repurchases will be made in the DEX, and the DEX where the main repurchase operation will be conducted will be announced before the repurchase.

The whole process of revenue generation and distribution is realized on the chain through smart contracts, which are completely open and transparent and subject to community-wide oversight. In the future, the main parameters of the revenue distribution can be changed through the community's voting governance.
